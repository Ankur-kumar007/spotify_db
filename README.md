## Overview

This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration

Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data

After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **SQL Queries**: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions
- **Tools**: pgAdmin 4 (or any SQL editor), PostgreSQL (via Homebrew, Docker, or direct installation)

## How to Run the Project

1. Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (if not already installed).
2. Set up the database schema and tables using the provided normalization structure.
3. Insert the sample data into the respective tables.
4. Execute SQL queries as written above.
5. Explore query optimization techniques for large datasets.

## Next Steps

- **Visualize the Data**: Use a data visualization tool like **Tableau** or **Power BI** to create dashboards based on the query results.
- **Expand Dataset**: Add more rows to the dataset for broader analysis and scalability testing.
- **Advanced Querying**: Dive deeper into query optimization and explore the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.
